### B function

<br>

What is it about? the B-function seems extremely easy at first glance to solve. However, this problem 
remains unsolved up to today's date. The B-function is defined as $B(x)=xsin(x)$ and the main goal is to
find all the roots of equation $B(x)=c$ for $c \in R$.

#### Terms
Let $B(x)$ be a function defined as $B(x)=xsin(x)$.<br>
Then, let's say $B_1(x)=\frac{dB}{dx}$, $B_2(x)=\frac{d^2B}{dx^2}$... Likewise, $B_{-1}(x)=\int B(x)$, $B_{-2}(x)=\int B_{-1}(x) = \int \int B(x)$. We take $B_{n}(x)=B[n](x)$.

Then, $\overline{B}(x)=xcos(x)$. Other rules from the normal B-function are applicable as well.
<br><br>The first fundamental B-function equation is 
$$ 
B(x)^2 + \overline B(x)^2 = x^2 
$$
And the second fundamental B-function equation is
$$
\frac{B(x)}{\overline B(x)} = tan(x)
$$

### Problem
Problem 1: to find all roots of equation $B(x)=c$, $c \in R$<br>
Subproblem 1: find any root<br>
Subproblem 2: find any other root assuming that you already have a finite amount of roots<br>
<br>
Problem 2: are there any $c$ where $c \ne 0$ and $c \in Q$ so there is at least one root $x$ where $x \in Q$?
